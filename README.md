# GUI Projects with Tkinter Geometry Managers

This repository contains three Python scripts demonstrating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using the tkinter library with different geometry managers: pack, grid, and place.

## Files

1. **pack.py**: Simple calculator interface using the pack geometry manager.
2. **grid.py**: Sign-up page interface using the grid geometry manager.
3. **place.py**: Login page interface using the place geometry manager.

## Instructions

### Running the Scripts
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the tkinter library if not already installed (`import tkinter`).
3. Run each Python script individually to launch the respective GUI interfaces.

### Description of Each Interface

#### 1. pack.py
- Implements a basic calculator interface.
- Features an entry box for input and buttons for numbers and basic calculations.
- Uses the pack geometry manager to organize widgets.

#### 2. grid.py
- Represents a sign-up page with text entry fields for name, email, and password.
- Includes a "Sign Up Now" button for form submission.
- Utilizes the grid geometry manager to arrange widgets in a grid layout.

#### 3. place.py
- Displays a login page with text entry fields for username and password.
- Incorporates an "Login" button for authentication.
- Utilizes the place geometry manager to precisely position widgets.
